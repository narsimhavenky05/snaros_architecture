🎯 snarOS v1.0 — realistic target

If you achieve THIS, you win.

snarOS 1.0 should be able to:

✅ Boot via UEFI
✅ Switch to long mode (x86_64)
✅ Display text on screen
✅ Handle keyboard input
✅ Have a basic kernel loop
✅ Simple memory allocator
✅ Basic filesystem (even fake one)

now tell to build version 1.0, how much time it takes for me to build.

Nani — I’ll be completely honest with you.
No motivation talk. No fake promises. Just reality.

⏱️ How long does it take to build snarOS v1.0 (solo)?

If your goal is a real, booting, understandable OS v1.0, then:

✅ 3 to 6 months — realistically
❌ Not weeks
❌ Not years

This assumes you work consistently, not 10 hours every day.

⚖️ Why not faster?

Because OS development is not coding speed —
it’s thinking speed.

You will spend time on:

Reading manuals

Understanding crashes

Debugging invisible bugs

Rebooting QEMU 1000 times

Fixing one-line mistakes that cost 2 days

That’s normal.

Every OS developer goes through this.

📆 Realistic timeline (solo developer)

Let’s break it properly.

🧱 Month 1 — Boot & CPU control

Goal:

“My code runs instead of firmware.”

What you’ll do:

UEFI bootloader
ELF loading
Switch to kernel
Long mode confirmation
Print text on screen

Result:
snarOS booting...
Kernel loaded successfully.


🔥 This moment changes everything.

Time: 3–4 weeks

🧠 Month 2 — Memory & interrupts

Goal:

“I control RAM and CPU events.”

You’ll build:

Page tables

Virtual memory
Basic heap (kmalloc)
IDT
Exception handlers
Panic screen

You will crash a LOT here.

That’s expected.

Time: 4–5 weeks

⌨️ Month 3 — Basic drivers

Goal:

“I can interact with the user.”

You’ll add:

Keyboard driver
Timer (PIT / HPET)
Simple input loop
Kernel shell (very basic)

Example:

snarOS> help
snarOS> meminfo
snarOS> reboot


This makes it feel like an OS.
Time: 3–4 weeks
📁 Month 4 — Minimal filesystem
Goal:
“I can store something.”

Options:
RAM-based filesystem
Very simple custom FS
Not FAT yet — keep it simple.

Commands:

ls
cat
echo hello > file

Time: 2–3 weeks
🧪 Month 5 — Stability & cleanup
This is the most important phase.

You will:
Remove hacks
Clean architecture
Improve logging
Write docs
Freeze features
No new features allowed.
Time: 2–3 weeks

🚀 Month 6 — snarOS 1.0 release

What you’ll do:
GitHub release
Version tag v1.0
README
Architecture diagrams
Roadmap v2.0
Website update
Now people can contribute.

🧠 Total time
Speed	Time
Very fast learner	~3 months
Realistic	4–6 months
With breaks	~7–8 months

Anything under 3 months means shallow understanding.
Anything above 1 year means overengineering.

⚠️ One critical warning (please read)

If you try to build:
GUI
Multitasking
Networking
Security model
POSIX compatibility
in v1.0 — you will fail.
Not because you’re weak.
Because every OS that succeeded delayed these.
Even Linux had no GUI.
🧩 What v1.0 actually proves
snarOS 1.0 does NOT need to be useful.
It needs to prove:
✅ You understand OS fundamentals
✅ Architecture is clean
✅ Code is readable
✅ Future expansion is possible

That’s enough.

🧠 What really matters more than time
Consistency.
Even 1–2 hours daily is enough.
But skipping weeks kills momentum.
OS development punishes gaps.
🫂 One last thing — very important

You are not behind.
You are exactly where every OS founder started:
Alone
Confused
Determined
Thinking too big
The difference between dreamers and builders is simple:
Builders finish v1.0.
That’s all.
If you want next, I can give you:

✅ Exact snarOS v1.0 feature list (locked scope)
✅ Daily / weekly task plan
✅ Folder structure final
✅ What to ignore completely
✅ Definition of “done”
✅ snarOS v1.0 README template

✅ Roadmap v2.0–v5.0
